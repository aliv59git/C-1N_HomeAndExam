            /*An integrated development environment (IDE) or interactive development environment is a software application 
             * that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists
             *  of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.

            * Some IDEs contain a compiler, interpreter, or both, such as Net Beans and Eclipse; others do not, such as 
             * SharpDevelop and Lazarus. The boundary between an integrated development environment and other parts of 
             * the broader software development environment is not well-defined. Sometimes a version control system and 
             * various tools are integrated to simplify the construction of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
             * 
             * 1. Microsoft Visual Studio. If you are looking for the definitive IDE for Windows application development, 
             * look no further than to Microsoft's own developer toolset. Visual Studio products cover languages like 
             * C++, C# and VB.NET.
             * 
             * 2. Oracle Netbeans 7. If you are more of a Java developer, Oracle's got your back with their Netbeans IDE. 
             * Of course, despite the fact that excellent Java support is its claim to fame going as far back as the Sun 
             * Microsystems days, other languages like C/C++, Ruby, HTML5, PHP and more are supported as well. Netbeans is 
             * extremely extensible via its plugin-centric design, allowing you to add additional language syntax support 
             * and libraries, among other things. Netbeans is free under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL).
             * 
             * 3. Eclipse. This IDE is quite comprehensive and even similar to Netbeans in a variety of ways, including its 
             * use of Java and plugin architecture. However, Eclipse as an IDE comes in a wild variety of flavors, catering to 
             * various needs and objectives in software development workflows. The Eclipse Foundation even provides a comparison 
             * page to view the differences between the variants of Eclipse. Eclipse is free under the terms and conditions 
             * of the Eclipse Foundation Software User Agreement unless otherwise specified.
             * 
             * 4. Code::Blocks. Unlike the other products seen thus far, Code::Blocks, which is built on the wxWidgets framework, 
             * is exceptionally lightweight in size, yet still quite functional and feature-rich IDE. You can load up a number 
             * of under-the-hood compiler engines, ranging from GCC and LLVM, to Digital Mars and Open Watcom. Code::Blocks also 
             * takes advantage of multi-core compiling, allowing you to get the job done faster. Code::Blocks is distributed 
             * under the GPL v3.0 license which means it can be used freely by anyone.
             * 
             * 5. Aptana Studio 3. If web and scripting languages are more of your style, Aptana is well suited for the task. 
             * PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python are supported as well as the likes of Adobe AIR. Even the studio itself is 
             * available as a plugin for Eclipse if you prefer the way Aptana handles your work and want to combine it with 
             * a more comprehensive IDE. Aptana Studio 3 is free and available solely under the GNU General Public License.
